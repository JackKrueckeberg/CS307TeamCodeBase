#### Problem Statement:


The current issue with finding a place to live is managing all of the different factors that go in to moving.  There are many sources for information; however, they are spread out across the web and not easily agglomerated by users.


#### Project Objectives:


 - A web based application that aids people looking to move to a new city in finding a place that fits all of their preferences.  
 - Use filters on databases of city information to match the user with cities that best fit them. 
 - Let the user choose which aspects of a city they want to be factored into their preferences. 
 - Compare cities' data on diversity, job opportunities, cost of living, social scene, school systems, crime rate, real estate market, types of businesses (corporate vs family owned), walkability, and more.
 - Users can create a list of favorite cites to help them narrow down their choices
 - Viewing pictures and maps of cities with common attractions
